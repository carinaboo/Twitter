# Project 4 - Twitter

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets from the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Hamburger menu
   - [x] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [x] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [x] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [x] Profile page
   - [x] Contains the user header view
   - [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline
   - [x] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Profile Page
   - [x] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [x] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account

The following **additional** features are implemented:

List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [ ] Profile page
   - [ ] 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Ran into a lot of issues with storyboard and animation. Git reseting to an earlier commmit that I know had correct view constraints suddenly messed up entire screens. It'd run but all the constraints weren't modifiable--the views weren't showing up at all either in Storyboard. Need betters ways to debug what happened and fix it. Ended up rebuilding screens, reseting constraints, and connecting them back to the view controllers.

Also animation. Still not sure why in a UITableViewCell, self.layoutIfNeeded() within a UIView.animate call worked on your computer but not mine. I also tried on Xcode 8.1, nothing changed. Also thought that laying out the cell would call layout on it's children (which includes the cell's contentView that I needed to call to fix it.)
